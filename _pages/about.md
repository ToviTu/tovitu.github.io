Hello, I am an undergraduate student in Data Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I work on applied Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am afflicated with the [WashU NLP Group](https://nlp.wustl.edu/) in the CSE department and the [Hengen Lab](https://hengenlab.org/) in the Biology department. 

My research interest broadly lies in the interdisciplinary field of CV and NLP, especially in the vision-language models. I woant to build multimodal systems that enjoys the nice generalization and interpretibility property of natural language and are capable of processing diverse channels of inputs. I am also interested in solving unique questions in specific domains, adapting popular models to take advantage of new assumptions.
