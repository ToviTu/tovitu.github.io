Hello, I am an undergraduate student in Data Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I work on applied Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am afflicated with the WashU NLP Group in the CSE department and the Hengen Lab in the Biology department. 

My research interest broadly lies in the interdisciplinary field of CV and NLP, especially in the vision-language models. I woant to build multimodal systems that enjoys the nice generalization and interpretibility property of natural language and are capable of processing diverse channels of inputs. I am also interested in solving unique questions in specific domains, adapting popular models to take advantage of new assumptions.
